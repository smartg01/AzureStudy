# Moving resources

* You can move resources to the following:
    * New region
    * New resource group
    * New Subscription

Some resources cant be moved but will create a new resource in the region / rg / subscription and then copy the data. This will happen for disks.

Some resources can only be moved to certain regions / rgs / subscription. Documentation will need to be checked.
