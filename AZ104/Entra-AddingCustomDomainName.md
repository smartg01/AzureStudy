# Adding Custom Domain names

Custom domain names options is available in the Entra ID menu.

In here, custom domain names can be added via the GUI. TXT / MX records will need to be added to prove that the domain is owned. Depending on Microsoft & your domain registra, it can take up to 24 hours for the domain to be verified.
